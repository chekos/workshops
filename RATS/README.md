# RATS on Jupyter Workshop
#### July 17th, 2018


These are the materials for the RATS in Jupyter Workshop of July 17th, 2018
***
## Goals for this workshop
"We’ll explore the Jupyter environment, what we can do with it, how you could integrate it into your work."
1. By the end of the hour you will know what a `jupyter notebook` is, how it looks, how to access them in our servers.
2. By the end of the hour you will know what `jupyter lab` is and the basics of how to navigate it, what its relationship is to `jupyter notebooks`, and we will have explored some ways it could be integrated into your workflow.
3. By the end of the hour you will have learned about resources where you can learn more about `jupyter` and some ways other scientists are using `jupyter` products in their research.

**Bonus**: If we have time we will have also coded our first interactive chart!:+1:
